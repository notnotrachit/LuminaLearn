## üåü Overview

LuminaLearn is a modern attendance management system designed for educational institutions that leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of attendance records. Built on Django and integrated with the Stellar blockchain, the system provides a secure, tamper-proof solution for tracking student attendance in courses and lectures.

The platform supports three user roles (Admin, Teacher, and Student) with role-specific dashboards and features. The core innovation lies in the blockchain integration, which creates an immutable record of attendance that can be independently verified, eliminating disputes and ensuring transparency.

## üèó Architecture
<div align="center">
  <img src="architecture.png" alt="LuminaLearn Logo" width="400"/>
</div>

LuminaLearn follows a layered architecture with four primary components:

### Frontend Layer
User interface implemented with Django templates, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Provides responsive views for different devices and user roles.

### Application Layer
Core business logic implemented in Django, handling user authentication, course management, attendance tracking, and reporting.

### Data Layer
Django ORM models storing application data, with relationships between users, courses, lectures, and attendance records.

### Blockchain Integration Layer
Integration with Stellar blockchain for secure attendance verification, with wallet management and transaction processing.

### Using Docker (Alternative)

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3

# Stellar Blockchain Settings
STELLAR_TESTNET=True
STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org

## üìù API Documentation

LuminaLearn offers a set of APIs for potential integration with other systems:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login/`: User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout/`: User logout
- `POST /api/auth/register/`: User registration

### Course Endpoints
- `GET /api/courses/`: List all accessible courses
- `POST /api/courses/`: Create a new course
- `GET /api/courses/{id}/`: Get course details
- `PUT /api/courses/{id}/`: Update course details
- `GET /api/courses/{id}/lectures/`: List course lectures

- `POST /api/lectures/{id}/attendance/`: Start attendance session
- `POST /api/attendance/verify/`: Verify attendance
- `GET /api/users/{id}/attendance/`: Get user attendance records

## ‚õì Blockchain Integration

LuminaLearn uses the Stellar blockchain to store immutable attendance records:

### Key Components
- **Stellar Accounts**: Each user gets a Stellar account (keypair)
- **Soroban Contract**: Smart contract for managing attendance records
- **Transactions**: Attendance is recorded as blockchain transactions

### Integration Flow
1. When a user signs up, a Stellar keypair is generated
2. The account is funded on testnet (via Friendbot)
3. When a student marks attendance, a transaction is created
4. Transaction hash is stored in the database as verification

### Verification
- All attendance records can be independently verified on the Stellar blockchain
- The system provides direct links to the Stellar Explorer to view transaction details

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- User passwords are hashed and never stored in plaintext
- Blockchain private keys should be encrypted in production deployments
- Session management with proper timeout and security

### Blockchain Security
- QR codes contain nonces to prevent replay attacks
- Each attendance session has a limited timeframe 
- Location verification can be enabled (future prospect)

## üìà Development Roadmap

### Short-term (0-3 months)
- Implement proper factory contracts for courses on the Stellar blockchain
- Enhance smart contract functionality for more robust attendance verification
- Add comprehensive test suite for blockchain interactions
- Improve QR code security with time-based expiration

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- Transform into a full Learning Management System (LMS)
- Add course content management (lectures, notes, assignments)
- Implement student assessment and grading functionality
- Develop notification system for upcoming lectures and deadlines
- Create dashboards with learning analytics

### Long-term (6+ months)
- Add support for digital credentials and certificates on blockchain
- Implement peer-to-peer learning features
- Develop AI-powered learning recommendations
- Create marketplace for educational content
- Enable cross-institution compatibility and credit transfers
